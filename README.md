# credit-risk-classification
This is my submission for Module 20 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

lending_data.csv data file in the Resources folder is used in credit_risk_classification.ipynb.

Running credit_risk_classification.ipynb will give you a notebook that uses a Logistic Regression Model to find out if a load will be a 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan). Also an analysis of the machine learning model and how it performed is provided.
